# An Average Workday Scheduler

# Description

This application is designed to allow a user to schedule and save tasks/reminders for their workday in 1 hour blocks, and is colour coded to indicate whether a time block is in the past, present or future.

The application uses dayjs to display the current time, and to check against whether a block is in the past, present or future. Functionality was added with jQuery and regular Javascript.

The app also stores the information in local storage, so a user can enter in whatever it may be, and when they come back to it on the same device, it will show the last saved information.
